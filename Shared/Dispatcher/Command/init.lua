--- An abstract Command to be issued through a Dispatcher.
-- The Command is updated by the Dispatcher and listens to the Dispatcher for
-- other commands to respond to. This is an abstract class and should be used
-- to inherit from in other commands. It should not be instantiated directly.

--- The default constructor.
-- Creates a new Command with a blank name.

-- @return the new Command

end

--- Updates the Command.
-- Performs all Command updates. Determines if the Command activates. The
-- command can activate multiple times with a single update. This should not be
-- called from the abstract class Command and should be overridden. This should
-- typically not be called directly and should be called by the associated
-- Dispatcher.

-- @param tick the current tick of the update
-- @return a table of all activations for this update

--- A listener for all Commands in the attached Dispatcher
-- Listens for incoming Commands and reacts accordingly. Often used to
-- determine whether or how to activate on the next update. This should
-- typically not be called directly and shoudl be called by the associated
-- Dispatcher.
--
-- @param ... all parameters passed by the activating command
