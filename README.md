	<h1>Vigilant</h1>
</div>

**Vigilant** is a free software *Roblox* game. It combines the gameplay features of MOBA and RTS games like *Dota 2*, or *Warcraft III* with the character mechanics of hero/class shooters such as *Overwatch* and *Team Fortress 2* along with twin stick style controls similar to games like *Alien Swarm*, *HELLDIVERS*, or *Magicka*. This creates a unique gameplay experience where players cooperate using their heroes' unique abilities to survive against relentless hordes of enemies.

Vigilant is a free to play cooperative game on Roblox designed to feel wholly unique among other games of the platform. It builds systems from the ground up to provide a striking experience that feels different than 'just another Roblox game'. It achieves this through custom frameworks for controls, asset definition, replication, particle systems, game events/effects, and more. Overall, it aims to push the bar of what a Roblox game is percieved to be.

## Usage
You can [play the game]((https://www.roblox.com/games/2510941316)) on [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/). There's no need to install Vigilant to play, simply click play on the game page and Roblox will handle its own installation and get you into the game as quickly as possible.

Vigilant uses [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) as a bridge between the filesystem and Roblox Studio. If you want to contribute or use Vigilant for development, install both to get started. The project contains a `default.project.json` that can be used by Rojo to generate or sync with a Roblox save file.

While the majority of the game is free to use and develop as you please, some parts of the published game such as game assets and designs aren't free. Free asset packs and creation tools for Vigilant are to come.
